## Project Description
The Water is Life Project is a groundbreaking initiative that combines blockchain technology, decentralized identity, and automated data processing to address the urgent global challenge of water quality. In collaboration with citizen scientists worldwide, this project aims to make a tangible impact on improving water quality for children, ultimately saving lives.

## Tools for Driving Impact
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS): We leverage EAS for on-chain attestations, providing a robust mechanism to verify and validate user identities within our decentralized network.

ComposeDB: Our choice of ComposeDB ensures that attestation data remains secure, tamper-proof, and readily accessible on the blockchain. This decentralized database forms the backbone of our trust network.

Bacalhau Batch Data Tool: The Bacalhau Batch Data Tool is the heartbeat of our project, automating data processing tasks. By seamlessly integrating with our platform, it streamlines the validation and processing of water quality data.

Silk Wallet: We've integrated the Silk Wallet to offer an embeddable and user-friendly wallet experience. This enhances the ease with which participants interact with Ethereum-based features, fostering a seamless and inclusive user experience.

## Social Impact
Water Quality Improvement Initiative: The Water is Life Project directly addresses the alarming statistic that approximately 400,000 children under the age of 5 die annually from water, sanitation, and hygiene-related diseases (UNICEF Triple Threat). Through decentralized attestations, we establish a trust network among citizen scientists, ensuring the credibility of data collected globally.

Citizen Scientists Decentralized Group: We envision a decentralized group of citizen scientists collaborating to improve water quality. The project empowers individuals worldwide to contribute to a shared goal, facilitated by on-chain attestations and an embeddable Silk Wallet.

## Technical Impact
On-Chain Attestations with ComposeDB: Demonstrating the technical capability of EAS and ComposeDB, our project securely stores attestation data on the blockchain. This establishes a robust foundation for building trust in identity-related transactions within our decentralized community.

Automated Data Processing with Bacalhau: The integration of Bacalhau showcases our commitment to technical innovation. This Batch Data Tool automates the processing of water quality data, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in our mission to improve global water quality.

## Getting Started (to be updated)

To get started developers should start by creating their `project` and `context` using the [Orbis Dashboard](https://useorbis.com/dashboard). The ID of the context created should be used in `_app.js`.

## Styles

Most of the colors can be updated in the `styles/global.css` file which contains CSS variables applied to the main `html` property.

## Running locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
